Design of a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave Radar (FMCW)

Oct 2014 â€“ Feb 2015

Project description
Achievements:
1. Designed and characterized a Cantenna using simulation software CST used as Radar Transmitter and Receiver
2. Near Field to Far Field Transformations and Field Computation computed using MATLAB
3. Field measurements namely i.)Indoor ii)Outdoor and iii)Anechoic Chamber performed
4. Radiation Pattern, Polarization, and gain of the Cantenna were studied.
